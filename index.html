    <h3><strong>THE SITUATION.</strong></h3>
    <p>Since 2019, more than 60,000 asylum seekers have been forced to live in tent cities scattered along the Texas-Mexico border, approximately 11,000 of whom currently reside in shelters and informal camps located on the Rio Grande River, in the cities of Reynosa and Matamoros. Sleeping in make-shift shelters and overcrowded tents with limited access to water, sanitation, and other basic necessities, the reality of these camps is stark. </p>
